# raidtools

Some basic LaTeX and PGF/TikZ style definitions for making FFXIV raid diagrams.
These require a modern LaTeX distribution and a version of the PGF package new enough to support `pics`.

I eventually want to make these into a package at some point, but for now they just exist as a `.tex` file which can be included via `\input{tikzrules.tex}`.
